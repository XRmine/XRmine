- 👋 Hi, I’m @XRmine

- 👀 I’m interested in developing on the XRP Ledger

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code simple application in order to better express our ideas and intent.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with the XRPL community as there are so many talanted individuals and projects out there.

- 📫 Anyone can reach out to us at any time at info@xrmine.io or through our social channels.

- 📱  We aim to build a mobile application to improve access to the Ledger, connecting to a users wallet with xumm.

- 🤝 View projects whitepaper, should you not know about them. Set trust lines of all tokens that are held within a faucet.

- ⛏️ Mine a daily token node that (when broken) will send users a % of the token contained within.

- What are we currently working on??

  Recently we have been creating a test app as we futher our understanding of coding and blockchain technology, Our test app is available as a repository as with all of our     testing we try to remain as open source as possible.
